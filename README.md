* Designed a [10 day course](https://github.com/rustyxlol/on-this-day) to learn DevOps tools!
* Terraformed for 6 hours straight only to realize what I was trying to achieve was impossible, curious to know what it was? It was me trying to peer two cross-regional VPCs, with auto load balancing, and auto scaling 😭
