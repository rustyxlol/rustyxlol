### Greetings traveler, fancy a drink?

Hello there. I am Rusty, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate currently residing in India.

I am an amateur programmer and have been working with **Python** for about a year now.
I like the high level aspect of Python, however I'm thinking of going back to front-end development.
I have also worked with **C**, **C#** and **JavaScript**.

I have been with computers since I was a kid and have been profoundly in love with mathematics ever since I found a teacher who would guide me through maths and life, which also ignited a passion for teaching.  

I love going on adventures with topics that I find intriguing. Particularly topics that have to do with mathematics and programming, such as Data Analytics/Machine Learning and the like.  

I am currently learning **how to draw**.
