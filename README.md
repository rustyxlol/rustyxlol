### Greetings traveler, fancy a drink?

Hello there. I am Rusty, a Computer Science and Engineering graduate currently residing in India.

I have been with computers since I was a kid and have been profoundly in love with mathematics ever since I found a teacher who would guide me through maths and life, which also ignited a passion for teaching.  

I love going on adventures with topics that I find intriguing. And for now, that cake goes to Systems and Data Engineering.
